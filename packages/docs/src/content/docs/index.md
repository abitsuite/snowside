Snowside is a dedicated Avalanche Layer-1 blockchain built to host Paul Sztorc's
upcoming eCash hard-fork. It runs as a clean EVM sidechain where the native gas
token is BTC itself — no new minted tokens, no pre-mine, just Bitcoin security
via blind merged mining.

## Key properties

## What Snowside solves

Paul Sztorc's previous EVM sidechain, EthSide, was discontinued because standalone
chain management was too time-consuming. Every update required manual
intervention. Every validator restart required SSH access. Every monitoring alert
required human attention.

Snowside solves this by combining:

1. **Bitcoin's economic security** via Blind Merged Mining — miners secure
   Snowside without running a full node
2. **Avalanche's high-performance consensus** — sub-second finality, sovereign
   validator set, full EVM compatibility
3. **NodeRunr's operational automation** — one-click deployment, 24/7
   monitoring, automatic zero-downtime updates

The result is a chain that is secure enough for Bitcoin purists, fast enough for
real applications, and operable enough to stay alive without constant human
intervention.

## Where to start

    Deploy a Snowside validator using NodeRunr in under a minute.
  </Item>
  <Item title="Deploy a contract">
    Use Foundry or Hardhat to deploy Solidity contracts to Snowside.
  </Item>
  <Item title="Bridge USDC">
    Transfer USDC from Avalanche's C-Chain to Snowside via ICM.
